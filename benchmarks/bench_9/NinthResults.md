# Results of Ninth Benchmark

## Parameters Given

Parameter | Material 1 | Material 2
--- | --- | ---
$\sigma_t$ | 2/101 | 200/101
$c$ | 0.90 | 0.90
$\lambda$ | 101/20 | 101/20

## Results

The exact values are those resulting from $1 \times 10^8$ realizations, with the exception of the 10.0 thickness data, which is calculated for $1 \times 10^6$ realizations for expediency.

The model values are those resulting from a convergence to $1 \times 10^{-9}$ percent error between iterations.
