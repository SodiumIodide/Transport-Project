# Results of Fourth Benchmark

## Parameters Given

Parameter | Material 1 | Material 2
--- | --- | ---
$\sigma_t$ | 10/99 | 100/11
$c$ | 0.00 | 1.00
$\lambda$ | 99/10 | 11/10

## Results

The exact values are those resulting from $1 \times 10^8$ realizations.

The model values are those resulting from a convergence to $1 \times 10^{-9}$ percent error between iterations.
